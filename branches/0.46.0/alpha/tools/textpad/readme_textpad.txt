Running scripts
---------------

You may want create a tool to edit and run PHPW (WinBinder) scripts. To do so, follow the steps below:

1) Call the Configure/Preferences menu. This will open the Preferences dialog.
2) Select the Tools item and click the Add button. Select the Program option. This will open the standard Open dialog box.
3) Locate php.exe. In my case it is at C:\@desenv\WinBinder\PHP\PHP4\php.exe. Press Open. This will take you back to the Preferences dialog.
4) Click the Apply button, then open the Tools item in the treeview: A new tool, called 'Php', will appear. Select it. This will show the tool properties.
5) Uncheck all checkboxes, with the optional exception of 'Save all documents first'.
6) You will probably want to assign a keyboard shortcut, say, F5, to the newly created tool. For that, while still in the Preferences dialog, select Keyboard. This will bring up the keyboard configuration screen.
7) Select the Tools category in the leftmost list box, then the item you have just created. Click on the shortcut edit field, then Press F5. Click Apply. 'F5' will appear on the lower right list.
8) Press OK to leave the Preferences dialog and you are done. Now you can open a .phpw file then run it simply by pressing F5.

1) Call the Configure/Preferences menu. This will open the Preferences dialog.
2) Select the Tools item and click the Add button. Select the Online Help File option. This will open the standard Open dialog box.

4) Click the Apply button, then open the Tools item in the treeview: A new tool, called 'Winbinder_manual', will appear.
5) You will probably want to assign a keyboard shortcut, say, Ctrl+2, to the newly created tool. For that, while still in the Preferences dialog, select Keyboard. This will bring up the keyboard configuration screen.
6) Select the Tools category in the leftmost list box, then the item you have just created. Click on the shortcut edit field, then Press Ctrl+2. Click Apply. 'Ctrl+2' will appear on the lower right list.

Building WinBinder
------------------

Skip this section if you do not want to build WinBinder yourself.

TextPad can be configured to run the makefile generated by your favorite compiler. To do so, follow the steps below:

1) Call the Configure/Preferences menu. This will open the Preferences dialog.
2) Select the Edit item and make sure the "Use POSIX regular expression syntax" option is checked.
3) Select the Tools item and click the Add button. Select the Program option. This will open the standard Open dialog box.
4) Locate your Make utility. In my case it is at C:\Util\lcc\bin\make.exe. Press Open. This will take you back to the Preferences dialog.
5) Click the Apply button, then open the Tools item in the treeview: A new tool (probably called 'Make') will appear. Select it. This will show the tool properties.
6) Configure it as follows:
	 Command is the name of your Make utility (C:\Util\lcc\bin\make.exe in my case).
	 Parameters: Check the documentation of your Make utility. Must be left empty for LCC-Win32.
	 Initial folder = The location of your makefile. In my case it is $WspDir\Compilers\Lcc-win32\php4, where $WspDir is the path to the TextPad workspace. You can also type an absolute path instead.
	 Check 'Capture output' and make sure all other other checkboxes are unchecked.
	 Check 'Save all documents first' if you want.
	 Enter the following regular expression in the appropriate field:

^.+ .*([A-Za-z]:[^:]+): ([0-9]+)

	 Select registers 1, 2 and blank, in this order.
	 Press Apply.
7) You will probably want to assign a keyboard shortcut, say, F9, to the newly created tool. For that, while still in the Preferences dialog, select Keyboard. This will bring up the keyboard configuration screen.
8) Select the Tools category in the leftmost list box, then the Make item. Click on the shortcut edit field, then Press F9. Click Apply. 'F9' will appear on the lower right list.
9) Press OK to leave the Preferences dialog.
10) Now you can build WinBinder simply by pressing F9. To check for errors or warnings, double-click the error/warning in the Command Results window so TextPad will open the file at the appropriate location. If it does not work, quit TextPad, start it again and recompile your program.
